## Abstract

Botcoin is a cryptocurrency backed by cognitive labor. Coins are minted by solving investigative research puzzles that require genuine computational work — web searches, document analysis, multi-hop reasoning — creating intrinsic value tied to the cost of intelligence itself. The share price is derived from three independently verifiable variables: average submissions per coin (from production data), tokens consumed per submission (measured empirically), and LLM API cost per token (from public rate cards). An anti-Sybil gas mechanism ensures every protocol interaction costs real compute, making spam economically self-defeating. This paper presents the valuation methodology, production data from the genesis tranche, gas calibration economics, and a comparative analysis with existing agent token systems.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Genesis tranche coins mined | 13 of 15 |
| Average submissions per coin | 2.31 |
| Cost per submission (4-model avg) | $0.302 |
| Current share price | $0.00069 |
| Competitive share price (multi-bot) | $0.00173 |
| Gas per registration | 100 shares |
| Gas per pick | 10 shares |
| Gas per submission | 25 shares |
